\section[Two--compartments model with social recruitment]{Two--compartments model of workers with social recruitment}

In \citeyear{khoury2011} a simple model was proposed by \citeauthor{khoury2011} to explore the social dynamics in
population interplay between castes of female workers.

Two compartment equations are given, where the non--negative real variables $H$ and $F$ represent the number of hive workers and the number of forager workers, respectively:

\begin{align}
    \diff{H}{t} &= \overbrace{E(H,F)}^{\text{eclosion}}- H \cdot R(H,F) \label{eq:kh11h} \\
    \diff{F}{t} &= H \cdot R(H,F)  - m \cdot F \label{eq:kh11f}
\end{align}

where $m$ is the forager mortality rate, and $R$ represents the \emph{recruitment} factor in the $H \to F$ transfer term.
Objects proposed in this model have proven insightful, and have been later incorporated in more sophisticated models, with slight variations.\footcite{ratti2017}


\paragraph{Recruitment with social inhibition.}
In the recruitment function
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Recr}
    R(H,F) = \alpha - \sigma \frac{F}{H+F} \; ,
\end{equation}
the maximum rate of recruitment $\alpha$ is attained when there are no foragers present in the colony.
The second term represents social inhibition in the recruitment process, and the authors
\textquote[{\footcite[3]{khoury2011}}]{\omissis assumed that social inhibition is directly proportional to the fraction of the total number of adult bees that are foragers, such that a high fraction of foragers in the hive results in low recruitment.}

\paragraph{}
Biological research hints at ethyl oleate exchange between honeybee workers as the main modulating process in social recruitment: for example, a colony will respond to a high mortality of foragers by \emph{reducing} social inhibition and thereby \textquote[\footcite{khoury2011}]{resulting in a precocious onset of foraging behaviour in young bees}.

In the opposite situation -- \emph{i.e.} when forager mortality is low -- the colony responds by \emph{increasing} social inhibition: more foragers feel the urge to refrain from flying outside and revert to in--hive duties.
This inhibition response in the recruitment process is allegedly driven by higher concentrations of ethyl oleate:
\textquote[{\footcite[1]{khoury2011}}]{Old forager bees transfer ethyl oleate to young hive bees via trophallaxis, which delays the age at which they begin foraging.}

\paragraph{}
Via this pheromonal mechanism the hive can mantain an equilibrium where its basic necessities (brood care and food flow) are satisfied.
In this scenario, the collective pheromonal response -- which reduces the recruitment rate -- increases with the intensity of ethyl oleate exchanges, which in turn is related to the ratio $\frac{F}{H+F}$: these assumptions motivate the presence of this factor in Equation~\eqref{eq:Recr}.


\paragraph{Death rates.}
As noted before, foragers are subjected to more diverse and intense stress factors than hive bees, whence the average lifespan of a female honeybee is longer as a hive worker, and is significantly shorter as a forager: \textquote[{\footcite[1]{khoury2011}}]{Survival of bees in the protected hive environment is high, but the survival of forager bees is much lower. \omissis The average foraging life of a bee has been estimated as less than seven days, because of the many risks and severe metabolic costs associated with foraging.}

The sink term $-mF$ in Equation~\eqref{eq:kh11f} accounts for foragers mortality;
the parameter $m$ sets the fraction of forager population that dies every day.

\paragraph{}
The absence of a mortality factor in the hive compartment (Equation~\eqref{eq:kh11h}) is a bold simplifying assumption,
justified by the focus of this paper in relating CCD to higher than normal forager mortality rates.\footcite[1,2,3,5]{khoury2011}


\paragraph{Eclosion.}
The term $E(H,F)$ accounts for eclosion of adult young workers in the hive class.
\textquote[{\footcite[2]{khoury2011}}]{\omissis the number of eggs reared in a colony (and hence the eclosion rate) is related to the number of bees in the hive. Big colonies raise more brood.}

The authors have chosen the form
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:eclos}
    E(H,F) = L \frac{H+F}{w + H + F} \; ,
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the queen's laying rate and $w$ determines the rate at which $E$ increases to $L$ as $E+F$ gets very large.
\footnote{In this section we will often use the shorthand $N=H+F$, the total number of workers present in the colony at a given time.}

This is a Holling type II function where the attack rate is $a=\frac{1}{w}$ and $w$ is the reverse image of the half--maximal output; in \figurename~\ref{img:eclos} we can see that increasing values of $w$ ``flatten'' the curve
as saturation is attained for greater values of $N$, and the graph of $E(N)$ ``leans'' to the right.

    \label{img:eclos}
\end{figure}

Later models\footcite{ratti2017} incorporated this basic proposal with type III Holling functional response and added modulating factors, but retained the core formulation very similar to what~\citeauthor{khoury2011} proposed in Equation~\refeq{eq:eclos}.


\subsection{Stability analysis}
We now carefully review the results given in the paper about the existence and stability of equilibria in the model \eqref{eq:kh11h}--\eqref{eq:kh11f}.

The authors used \textquote[{\cite[3]{khoury2011}}]{standard linear stability analysis and phase plane analysis} to examine the model equations.
Re--tracing their steps, we will look for criteria for the existence of trivial and non--trivial equilibria, \ie zeroes of the right--hand side of our model equations.

When existence of an equilibrium point is estabilished, the jacobian matrix of the dynamical system is
evaluated at that point; then a simple sufficient criterion for asymptotic
stability\footnote{See Theorem~\ref{teo:pozzoLineare}.}
is that $\Re (\lambda) < 0$ for each eigenvalue $\lambda$.
Another simple technique due to Lyapounov is to exhibit a function that has a strong local minimum
over the equilibrium point.\footnote{See Theorem~\ref{teo:lyapounovFunc}.}

\paragraph{}
Note that $H, E$ have non--negative range, \ie $H(t), E(t) \geq 0$ for all $t$.
Also, all parameters in the model have to be strictly positive.

The next result states a necessary condition for all equilibria.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:necessJ}
    All equilibrium points $(H^*, F^*)$, if they exist, have to verify $F^* = J H^*$, where
    \begin{equation}
        J \coloneq \frac{1}{2} \left[
            \frac{\alpha}{m} - \frac{\sigma}{m} - 1 +
            \sqrt{ {\left( \frac{\alpha}{m} - \frac{\sigma}{m} - 1 \right)}^2
                + 4 \frac{\alpha}{m}
            }
        \right].
        \label{eq:kh11posEqJ}
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}

That is to say, equilibria lie on the ray $F= JH$ in the phase plane, when they exist.

\paragraph{}
We calculated the jacobian matrix of this system as:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        L \frac{w}{{(w + H + F)}^2} - \alpha + \sigma \frac{F^2}{{(H+F)}^2} &
        L \frac{w}{{(w + H + F)}^2} + \sigma \frac{H^2}{{(H+F)}^2}
        \\
        \alpha - \sigma \frac{F^2}{{(H+F)}^2} &
        - \sigma \frac{H^2}{{(H+F)}^2} - m
    \end{pmatrix}
    \label{eq:jacoGeneral}
\end{equation}

It is interesting to note that the last row of the jacobian is constant under
condition~\eqref{eq:kh11posEqJ},
\ie substituting $H$ for $\frac{1}{J} F$ in Equation~\eqref{eq:jacoGeneral},
we get:
\begin{gather}
    \diffp*{ \dot{H} }{H}{H= \frac{1}{J} F} =
    L \frac{w}{ {\left[ w + \left( \frac{1}{J} +1 \right) F \right]}^2 } - \alpha
    + \frac{ \sigma }{ {\left( \frac{1}{J} + 1 \right)}^2 } \; ,
    \\
    \diffp*{ \dot{H} }{F}{H= \frac{1}{J} F} =
    L \frac{w}{ {\left[ w + \left( \frac{1}{J} +1 \right) F \right]}^2 }
    + \frac{ \sigma }{ {\left( J + 1 \right)}^2 } \; ,
    \\
    \diffp*{ \dot{F} }{H}{H= \frac{1}{J} F} =
    \alpha - \frac{ \sigma }{ {\left( \frac{1}{J} + 1 \right)}^2 } \; ,
    \\
    \diffp*{ \dot{F} }{F}{H= \frac{1}{J} F} =
    - \frac{ \sigma }{ {\left( J + 1 \right)}^2 } - m \; ,
    \label{eq:jacoOnJFH}
\end{gather}
the last two equations depend only on the parameters and not on the variables H and F.

\subsubsection{Trivial equilibrium}
The trivial $(0,0)$ equilibrium is clearly a solution\footnote{Hence, the trivial equilibrium always exists.}
of $\dot{H}=\dot{F}=0$, and its stability is an important matter of study. Parameter regions where this equilibrium is stable and attractive usually mean the inevitable doom of the entire colony.

The system jacobian evaluated at the origin is:
\begin{equation}
    D_{00} \coloneq
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{L}{w} -\alpha &
        \frac{L}{w}
        \\
        \alpha & -m
    \end{pmatrix}
    \label{eq:jacoEquZero}
\end{equation}

By Theorem~\ref{teo:pozzoLineare}, we can see why
condition~\ref{eq:cond6b}
$$\alpha -\frac{L}{w}>0$$
is useful for characterization of stability in the origin.\footcite[3]{khoury2011}

Under that hypothesis,
$$\det  J_{00} > 0 \quad \iff \quad
m > \frac{\alpha L}{w} {\left( \alpha - \frac{L}{w} \right)}^{-1}$$
implies
$$\tr J_{00} = - \left( \alpha - \frac{L}{w} \right) - m < 0$$
then, positive determinant and negative trace implies stability of the trivial equilibrium.


\subsubsection{Positive equilibrium}
We now investigate in detail the existence and stability of positive equilibria; such points should represent a positive outcome for a surviving colony.

\paragraph{}
A couple of results is presented in order to build a criterion for the existence of a positive equilibrium point.

\begin{teorema}[Uniqueness of the positive equilibrium]
    If the model \refeq{eq:kh11h}--\refeq{eq:kh11f} admits a positive equilibrium $(H^*, F^*)$, then it is unique.

    It is determined by both Eq.~\refeq{eq:kh11posEqJ} and the following:
    \begin{equation}
        F^* = \frac{L}{m} - w \frac{J}{1+J} \; .
        \label{eq:kh11posEqF}
    \end{equation}

    \label{teo:exUniqFstarPos}
\end{teorema}

This model always admits one or two distinct equilibrium points, based on the next result:

\begin{teorema}[Existence criterion]
    A necessary and sufficient condition for the model \refeq{eq:kh11h}--\refeq{eq:kh11f} to have a strictly positive equilibrium $P^* \coloneq (H^*, F^*)$ is given by cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[1.] If $\alpha - \frac{L}{w} >0$, then $P^*$ exists $\iff m_1^* < m < m_2^*$;
        \item[2.] If $\alpha - \frac{L}{w} <0$, then $P^*$ exists $\iff m > m_2^*$;
        \item[3.] If $\alpha - \frac{L}{w} =0$, then $P^*$ exists $\iff m > m_3^*$;
    \end{itemize}
    where
    \begin{equation}
        m_3^* = \frac{ \sigma L}{ w (\alpha + \sigma) } \; ,
        \label{eq:FstarPosM3}
    \end{equation}
    and $m_1^*, m_2^*$ are taken alwas in the order $m_1 < m_2$ from the following
    \begin{equation}
        m_{1,2} = \frac{L}{2w} \frac{ \alpha + \sigma \pm \sqrt{ {(\alpha - \sigma)}^2 +\frac{4 \sigma L}{w}  } }
        {\alpha -\frac{L}{w}} \; .
        \label{eq:FstarPosM12}
    \end{equation}

    \label{teo:esistenzPosF}
\end{teorema}

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
\label{par:interpretationCond6b}
We note that all situations where $m$ is given a lower bound can be related to intrinsic simplifications in the model, and cannot describe accurately a hive in a real apiary on a real field; the non--existence of a positive equilibrium when $m< \hat{m}$ for some $\hat{m}$ is simply because the total population diverges to infinity in such cases.

Conversely, the condition
\begin{equation}
\alpha - \frac{L}{w} > 0
    \label{eq:cond6b}
\end{equation}
can be read easily as $w \alpha >L$, where both sides have unit of bees/day; note also that the right--hand one captures the ``efficiency'' of the social recruitment process in the hive, while the left--hand side is the ``egg--laying efficiency'' of the queen.

That is to say, Equation~\eqref{eq:cond6b} means that the recruitment process $R= R(H, F)$ is capable of sustaining the level $L$ of egg--laying in the hive, by balancing the need for bees in the $H$ compartment (for brood care) and the need for bees in the $F$ compartment (for food intake).

\paragraph{}
Conditions in the form $m< \hat{m}$ typically ensure the survival of the colony;
in such parameter regions, this model can also exhibit the non--existence of a
positive equilibrium, simply because of the divergence of total population numbers.

As noted before, this model doesn't have a mortality factor for the $H$ compartment: in light of this fact, we
can explain condition~\eqref{eq:cond6b} as it as a lower bound for a steady transfer of hive bees to the
forager compartment, in which they have a finite life expectancy.

In the asymptotic limit, $\frac{L}{w} H$ bees enter the hive compartment through eclosion and $\alpha H$ bees
are withdrawn to the $F$ compartment: condition~\eqref{eq:cond6b} then says that the maximal recruitment rate
must be sufficiently large to unload the excess hive bees towards the foragers compartment.
