A Quantitative Model of Honey Bee Colony Population Dynamics
Figure 3
Phase plane diagrams of solutions to the model for different values of m.

Each line on the diagrams represents a solution trajectory, giving the number of foragers F and the number of hive bees H. As time t increases the solutions change along the trajectory in the direction of the arrows. In (a) m = 0.24 and the populations tend to a stable equilibrium population, marked by a dot. In (b), m = 0.40 there is no nonzero equilibrium and the hive populations collapses to zero. Parameter values are L = 2000,  = 0.25,  = 0.75 and w = 27 000.
